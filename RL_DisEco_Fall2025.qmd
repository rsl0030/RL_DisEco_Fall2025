## 

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

![](Downloads/ss_table.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. **Sample size = 59 deer**
2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
    1.  95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population. **Sample size = 290 (greater than scenario #2, which has a higher confidence level and prevalence)**
    2.  99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population. **Sample size = 224 (less than scenario #1, which has a lower confidence level and prevalence)**
3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_%. **Based on this finding, I am 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \<1% (3/n = 3/300 = 0.01).**
