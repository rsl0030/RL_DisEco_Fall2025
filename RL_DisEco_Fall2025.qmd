Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

![](Downloads/ss_table.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. **Sample size = 59 deer**
2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
    1.  95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population. **Sample size = 290 (greater than scenario #2, which has a higher confidence level and prevalence)**
    2.  99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population. **Sample size = 224 (less than scenario #1, which has a lower confidence level and prevalence)**
3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_%. **Based on this finding, I am 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \<1% (3/n = 3/300 = 0.01).**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Midterm Exam

1.  a\. False – while microparasites do have a shorter generation time, they do reproduce within the host.

    b\. False – while disease models can’t provide a true prediction of how a disease will spread in a real-world host population with certainty, they can be used to formulate our thinking about complex disease systems and as a decision-making tool.

    c\. False – contagious diseases are infectious diseases with animal to animal transmission; this disease appears to be infectious, which is one that is caused by pathogens that are transmissible (note: not all infectious diseases are contagious).

    d\. False – while Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) is most severe in the northern latitudes of the U.S. (sporadic occurrence and minimal population immunity), endemic EHD in portions of the southern U.S. typically see low mortality.

    e\. True (white-tailed deer with brain worms would be considered infected, and would also be considered diseased in the infrequent instances of exhibiting symptoms. When the worm eggs spread via feces, the deer would also be considered infectious).

    f\. True.

2.  Prevalence and incidence are both measures of frequency of occurrence. However, prevalence is the number affected as a proportion of the total population, whereas incidence is the number of new cases of disease occurring during a fixed period of time, divided by the number of animals at risk of developing the disease during that time. While prevalence is a “snapshot” of how many animals have a disease at a point in time, incidence is a measure of risk, focusing on new cases of a disease.

3.  a\. 2

    b\. 7

    c\. 3

    d\. 5

    e\. 1

    f\. 4

4.  dead-end hosts

5.  a\. γ = 1 / avg. infectious period = 1 / 8 = **0.125 per day**

    b\. γ = 1 / avg. infectious period = 1 / 14 = **0.071 per day**

    c\. R0 = β / γ ... so, β = R0 \* γ = 15 \* 0.125 = **1.875 per day (Measles)**\
    R0 = β / γ ... so, β = R0 \* γ = 17 \* 0.071 = **1.207 per day (rotavirus)**

    d\. Reff = R0 \* ( S / N ) = 1.875 \* 0.2 = **0.375**

6.  1\. Infected but not diseased – this is possible, as a host can be infected without disease – an example is brain worm in whitetail deer in the eastern US (the parasite rarely causes disease, but the deer is infected nonetheless).

    2\. Infected and diseased – this is possible, as a host can be infected and diseased – an example is mpox (a human is infected with the virus and exhibits symptoms such as rash or fever).

    3\. Not infected but diseased – this is possible, as in the case of a human carrying a genetic disease (a human with cystic fibrosis is diseased but by no externally-derived infection).

7.  The incubation period is regarded as the period from the point of infection to the exhibiting of clinical signs/symptoms. For Campylobacteriosis, it appears the incubation period may be as short as 1-2 days, since cases were seen right around the precise dates that Christmas work parties would be held. For Norovirus gastroenteritis, it appears that cases were seen around 24 hours after the Christmas party, suggesting an incubation period of approximately 24 hours.

8.  This extraordinary mortality event was determined to have been caused by hemorrhagic septicemia. It was caused by a bacteria, Pasteurella multocida, that is well-known to exist in the presence of these animals. Upon further investigation and modeling, it was realized that the mortality event was caused by separate and independently harmless circumstances. A combination of the congregation of pregnant Saiga antelope (in relatively high stress/pressure)(notably similar in discomfort to that of shipping fever) and unusually high relative humidity and temperature leading up to the event made the bacteria pathogenic. Unfortunately, it is unreasonable to expect to be able to control/eliminate a bacteria that is a common inhabitant of the species’ nasal passages, or to capture and vaccinate such a large/wild population. Broader conservation strategies might include allowing the species the ability to leverage its rapid reproduction capabilities, reducing other threats like poaching (to reduce stress), and/or managing the vaccination of livestock that interact with Saiga antelope.

9.  As detailed in our lecture, this perspective of human actions driving the ecological issue of wildlife disease seems well-founded, and I agree with the notion. One example highlighted in the lecture is the fact that human activity is interfering with wildlife habitat to such an extent that the ability of wildlife population repair is being impacted. Second, it was indicated that the collective toll from disease has inhibited conservation efforts for many varieties of species. Both of these considerations point to a clear ecological connection between wildlife disease and human actions.

10. R0 is the basic reproduction number – the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population. It is a metric of the potential transmissibility of an infectious agent. In the context of real-world utility of R0, individual variation in infectiousness has been widely documented, and underlying heterogeneity matters. However, a simplistic interpretation of R0 is that the infection will continue to spread in a host population if R0 is greater than 1, but will fade out if R0 is less than 1. \
    For the following scenario, 1 case infects 1, 1 case infects 3, 1 case infects 2, and 1 case infects 0. (1 + 3 + 2 + 0) / 4 = 1.5 ... therefore, R0 = 1.5, indicating the infection will continue to spread in the host population.

11. a\. 2015: Incidence = \# new cases / \# animals at risk = 4 / (133 – 0) = 0.030 cases per turtle-year\
    2016: Incidence = \# new cases / \# animals at risk = 5 / (125 – 2) = 0.041 cases per turtle-year\
    **2017: Incidence = \# new cases / \# animals at risk = 8 / (112 – 4) = 0.074 cases per turtle-year (highest year)**\
    2018: Incidence = \# new cases / \# animals at risk = 4 / (145 – 5) = 0.029 cases per turtle-year\
    2019: Incidence = \# new cases / \# animals at risk = 2 / (136 – 4) = 0.015 cases per turtle-year

    b\. **2015: Prevalence = \# infected / \# total host population = 4 / 133 = 0.030 = 3.0% (lowest)**\
    2016: Prevalence = \# infected / \# total host population = 7 / 125 = 0.056 = 5.6%\
    **2017: Prevalence = \# infected / \# total host population = 12 / 112 = 0.107 = 10.7% (highest)**\
    2018: Prevalence = \# infected / \# total host population = 9 / 145 = 0.062 = 6.2%\
    2019: Prevalence = \# infected / \# total host population = 6 / 136 = 0.044 = 4.4%

12. 5400 / 2 = 2700 adults ... 2700 \* 0.4 = 1080 adults immune to PDV. Vaccination coverage necessary = 1 - (1 / R0 ) = 1 - (1 / 3) = 0.667 ... 0.667 \* (5400 – 1080) = **\~2881 seals**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worksheet 4: Multihost pathogens, Spillover

1\. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. **Incorrect – MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in camel populations.**

2\. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. **Correct.**

3\. Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. **Incorrect – limited human-to-human transmission is indicated to occur after close contact, which suggests humans are not dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.**

4\. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. **Incorrect – the case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is noted to be approximately 35%.**

5\. The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak. **Correct – this is reflected in the rapid increase of cases, followed by a gradual decrease over time.**

6\. Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral factors that may have contributed to this trend. **There are a number of possible factors that may have contributed to this sharp decline in global cases. A possible epidemiological factor may relate to non-persistence, in that perhaps those who survive got immunity from the virus. A behavioral factor that may have contributed to this pertains to public health measures guiding human behavior, perhaps restricting/reducing contact.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worksheet 5: Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024

1\. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification. **Based on our learning of Fenton and Pederson’s framework of community epidemiology, I would argue that this Marburg virus outbreak began as a spillover event and subsequently became an emerging infectious disease. The virus’ natural reservoir appears to have been the Egyptian rousette bats (H1), and the human’s (H2) contraction of the disease represents the cross-species infection characteristic in a spillover event. Following the contraction of the disease by H2 (humans), the high within-H2 transmission rate that followed reflects the classification of an emerging infectious disease.**\

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings? **As the C.T. Nutt article discusses, there is tremendous value in a “commitment to clinical excellence linked to the pursuit of health equity,” and when a strong, coordinated response can “halt transmission and save the lives of infected people.” In the community setting, education and awareness would be key to ensuring mindful use of personal protective equipment and other protective practices to avoid person-to-person transmission, and the seeking of medical evaluation early upon transmission. In the healthcare setting, this use of personal protective equipment would also be essential, but further, the demonstrated sense of solidarity, as seen in Rwanda’s approach to MVD, among healthcare professionals and policymakers. For reducing the risk of transmission, there would be great value in emulating Rwanda’s efforts in contact tracing, exploring new tools, and embracing a willingness for international collaboration.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worksheet 7: Nipah Virus, Langya Henipavirus & Avian Reovirus

\
Nipah Virus: Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting. **In Malaysia, the transmission of the virus begins when an infected bat eats a portion of a fruit, leaving traces of the virus on the fruit. When a pig eats the fruit, it serves as a bridge host, ultimately passing it along to the human workers that work closely with the pigs, and they then develop symptoms. In this setting, an example of appropriate preventative measures includes an emphasis on the use of PPE to minimize risk of contact with infected animals, correlated with this mode of transmission. In Bangladesh, the transmission occurs in the context of sugar production from date palm sap. During this production, infected bats will try to enter the pots of sap, and will often defecate and/or urinate in the pots. When humans consequently consume the product that has been tainted by the virus, they will have been infected from these bats’ excretions. In this setting, due to the mode of transmission, appropriate preventative efforts include public education on the importance of not consuming raw date palm sap.**\

Avian Reovirus: Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population. **The lecture highlights that both vertical and horizontal transmission of ARV occurs. One example of a transmission route is fecal-oral, and is often seen when infected chicks transmit the virus to the rest of the proximal hatch. Favorable environmental factors include poor litter hygiene, overcrowding, and poor ventilation. Another example is through egg transmission, and with regard to serotypes, the characteristic of antigenic variation supports this route as it complicates protection. A wild bird disease caused by ARV is winter mortality for crows. Spreading through the fecal-oral route, the virus takes advantage of overcrowded roosts, attacking internal organs and causing tissue death, followed quickly by death.**

\
Langya henipavirus: Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? **The likely natural reservoir of LayV is shrews, who transmit the virus to humans through contact with shrew saliva, blood, etc. Shrews are invaders of crops and farmlands, so this transmission often occurs in such rural areas. Because the cases have remained very low, local, and sporadic, and has not transmitted on a global scale (no secondary cases – representing isolated zoonotic spillovers), LayV has just been classified as a spillover.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worksheet 8: Raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis)

**This data, derived from an examination of raccoon roundworm (B. procyonis), shares insight into prevalence patterns and allows for comparisons between groups. For example, when comparing prevalence of B. procyonis between male and female raccoons, QPweb helps find that females demonstrate a prevalence of 64.9% and males demonstrate a prevalence of 37.7%—with a p-value of 0.0087, one can state that this difference is statistically significant. Another meaningful comparison is seen when comparing prevalence of B. procyonis with region. The north has a prevalence of 28.6%, central has a prevalence of 64.3%, and the south has a prevalence of 62.8%—and with a p-value of 0.0016, this difference is also noted to be statistically significant. Overall, for the entire dataset, the prevalence of B. procyonis is calculated at 47.2%, with a lower CL of 37.7% and an upper CL of 56.8%. When analyzing this information, there are several observations that can be made. One is that B. procyonis was more prevalent in female raccoons, and another is that the prevalence was notably lower in the north region, when compared with the central and south regions.**

Term Project: Memo (Marburg Virus Disease)

**MEMORANDUM**\
\
To: Washington State Department of Health\
From: Rowan Lucey – Disease Ecology (FORY 7200: Fall 2025)\
Date: November 24, 2025\
Subject: Marburg Virus Disease\
\
OVERVIEW\
\
Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) is a rare disease, but it has the potential to cause outbreaks leading to high fatality rates. The causative agents of MVD are Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV), coming from the species Orthomarburgvirus marburgense (World Health Organization, 2025). The natural reservoir is the fruit bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus—demonstrating the species’ role in MVD’s maintenance and spread, fruit bats have a subclinical infection with MARV, and shed the virus to humans. Transmission in this manner specifically occurs through contact with fruit bat excreta, but can also transmit through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected individual, or exposure in laboratory or healthcare settings (Soni & Rathish, 2025). The initial transmission from bats to humans, demonstrating the spillover infection, occurs from a human’s prolonged exposure within caves inhabited by fruit bats. Transmission between humans occurs when infected blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids comes into direct contact with an uninfected individual’s broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth. It is important to note that while the disease cannot be transmitted before a human has symptoms, the human remains infectious as long as the virus remains in their blood (World Health Organization, 2025). The disease is named for the German city in which the first known cases came about in 1967, when scientists became ill after handling monkeys brought from Africa. Indeed, Sub-Saharan Africa is where cases of MVD have most commonly been found (CDC, 2025). The incubation period—the length of time from infection to the emergence of symptoms—can be as brief as 48 hours, and as long as 21 days. Clinical presentation of the disease depends, in part, on the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. Within the first week, symptoms may include:

-   High fever

<!-- -->

-   Severe headache

<!-- -->

-   Muscle pains and cramping

<!-- -->

-   Severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting

<!-- -->

-   Non-itchy rashes

To follow, symptoms often include the presence of blood—for example, blood may be found within vomit or feces, or discharging from the nose, gums, or vagina. Other symptoms reported at this stage include confusion, irritability, and orchitis. In instances of fatal cases, death typically occurs following severe blood loss, around 8 or 9 days after the emergence of symptoms (World Health Organization, 2025).\
\
Due to its strong ability to transmit between humans, and the potential for high fatality rates from an outbreak, the implications of an imported case of MVD in the United States poses a threat worthy of education and surveillance. In the event of a case being detected within the United States, the potential for the disease to spread steadily among humans presents a notable public health risk. The pathogen might emerge in a non-endemic region like the United States due to an infected person returning from international travel to a country like Rwanda, for example, where a significant outbreak occurred in 2024. Perhaps this individual was working in caves and came into contact with bat feces tainted with the virus, or they had contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person when visiting a hospital. As this person returns to the United States, it is likely that adequate time has passed for symptoms to emerge, at which point this infected individual may infect others. Perhaps they are admitted to a hospital to address their symptoms of a high fever and severe abdominal cramping—and without adequate personal protective equipment or isolation, healthcare workers may be exposed to the pathogen, and so continues the path of transmission.\
\
RECOMMENDATIONS\
\
While the current risk of infection with Marburg Virus Disease in the United States is considered low, the global case fatality rate has an average of approximately 50%, with an outbreak-specific high of 88% (World Health Organization, 2025)—therefore, this memorandum serves as an informational alert to promote community engagement. There are several recommended steps for public health prevention of, and response to, Marburg Virus Disease. Education of travelers and healthcare providers will be essential to preventing the spread of the disease. When effectively utilized, education can ensure that awareness of the disease and its symptoms is present, especially in higher risk settings such as hospitals and broader endemic regions. The safe management of suspected cases will also benefit from such education—in a hospital setting, for example, infection control is imperative. Due to the risk of human-to-human transmission in a healthcare setting, the ability to recognize MVD’s symptoms can prevent further infection. Close physical contact with infected patients should be avoided when possible, and appropriate isolation protocol should be followed for those with suspected or confirmed Marburg Virus Disease. However, when contact is possible or necessary, the use of personal protective equipment is essential in reducing the likelihood of transmission from the patient’s tainted bodily fluids.\
\
Wherever possible, the improvement of disease surveillance systems is another recommended opportunity for outbreak prevention with Marburg Virus Disease. With stronger surveillance capabilities—including the use of data to visualize trends—more precise attention can be committed to monitoring case emergence, tracking the overall public health threat, and then responding with appropriate action to suppress further transmission.\

Worksheet 9

1\. In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection. **One specific human behavior that contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella was allowing children to be near the birds. As this demographic is more likely to engage with the birds, it creates an opportunity for direct contact and transmission. Another practice by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk was infrequent and/or inconsistent sanitation practices—this allowed for contaminated surfaces, soil, footwear, etc., to pass on the bacteria to the next individual to come into contact with it. Proper hygiene and sanitation practices would help to interfere with transmission via this pathway. A third behavior simply pertains to how flock owners view/perceive the birds. While they may implement stringent working protocol, it wasn’t uncommon for owners to promptly proceed in cuddling with the birds, etc., therefore endangering the biosecurity that was diligently put in place.**

\
2. Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.\
a. What advantage does tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte? **Tall fescue grass infected with a fungal endophyte gains higher tolerance to stressors like drought and grazing. This increased tolerance allows for healthier, quality grass.**

b\. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? **Some of the key environmental and ecological factors that drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems include: (1) temperature and drought stress – these increase alkaloid production, (2) soil fertility and microbial communities – these affect endophyte expression, and (3) grazing management – this influences toxin accumulation and disease risk.**

c\. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? **Key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle include weight loss, rough and discolored coats, and poor performance.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worksheet 10

1\. What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? **The routes of transmission for African Swine Fever include: (1) vector born routes (e.g., tick bites), (2) direct contact (e.g., with an infected pig’s blood, saliva, or feces), (3) indirect contact (e.g., contaminated feed, transport trucks, equipment, workers’ clothing), (4) environmental persistence (ASF can survive for months in carcasses and pork products), and (5) human factors (it is key to note that humans act as mechanical vectors, not biological hosts). Humans play a significant role in the spread and transmission of ASF. Examples include their movement of pigs and pork products across borders, feeding practices (e.g., swill feeding), illegal trade (e.g., wild boar meat and untreated pork), poor surveillance (e.g., delayed detection in smallholder systems), and socioeconomic aspects (poverty and limited compensation discourage the act of reporting).**

2\. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas. **KoRV causes an acquired immunodeficiency virus. It suppresses the immune system of koalas, which makes chlamydial infections more prevalent and symptomatically worse for the koalas. Koalas with KoRV exhibit greater bacterial loads due to their reduced immune response, and further, coinfection of the two drives higher mortality and infertility rates.**

3\. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)? **As highlighted in the lecture, a diagnostic challenge pertains to false negatives in qPCR testing, the DNA test checking for fungus. Surveillance of SFD can also be challenged by the fact that symptom onset may be delayed if the snakes remain inactive, such as during brumation, or the symptoms may be too subtle for accurate detection. Management of SFD is challenged, in part, by the fact that options for treatment are rather limited or impractical, especially in the case of wild snakes.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Exam

1\. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect.

a\. Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and no within—target species transmission will be termed a spillover. **False: A disease caused by a pathogen with these properties would be termed an apparent multihost pathogen. A spillover would be a cross-species infection with low between-species transmission and low within-H2 transmission rate.**

b\. A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious. **False: A viral disease transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors would indeed be infectious, but would not be considered contagious, a term that pertains to direct human-human transmission.**

c\. The eggs of Baylisascaris procyonis can be transmitted to humans by direct contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon. **False: Transmission cannot occur immediately upon excretion, as there is an incubation period (up to approximately 4 weeks) before the eggs are infectious.**

d\. A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production. **False: Tall fescue grass infected with a fungal endophyte gains higher tolerance to stressors like drought and grazing, and this increased tolerance allows for healthier, quality grass. When cattle graze, it is fescue toxicity that may cause clinical signs of weight loss and poor milk production performance.**

e\. Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus. **False: Cardinals are considered supersuppressors, as they fail to amplify transmission, being less competent hosts.**

2\. List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? **As there is no vaccination or treatment, the only way to prevent transmission is to break its cycle. Various interventions include the filtering of water (e.g., using a LifeStraw) (which stops the digestion-resistant larvae from migrating to the small intestine), preventing people/animals with emerging Guinea-worms from entering water sources (which lowers the risk of someone drinking water fleas with the infective larvae that came from another’s bursted worm in the water), and the targeted use of larvicide ABATE in stagnant water sources (directly killing larvae). However, dogs started being found with infections in Chad, for example, now serving as reservoirs. This evolving threat led to the need for tethering dogs to keep them out of water and not allowing them to eat potentially contaminated fish entrails.**

3\. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD? **Among the many management challenges, a key aspect is that there are limited tools for effectively controlling the spread of this disease that has no vaccination or treatment. Obstacles include the difficulty in detecting infectious individuals, the imperfect detectability in the early phase of an outbreak, its asymptomatic transmission (direct and environmental), and by the time CWD is detected in a population, it is already established and difficult to eliminate. Further, having multiple stakeholders involved (e.g., hunters, BLM, Department of Agriculture) means that management is limited by logistical, financial, and sociopolitical considerations.**

4\. You are given data from a closed study population of 60 RFID-tagged armadillos monitored at sampling stations (no capture required). At the start of the study (December 2024) none were infected with Mycobacterium leprae. During the follow-up period, monthly assessments documented the following counts of infected animals in the population:

• March 2025: 3 infected

• April 2025: 5 infected

• May 2025: 5 infected

• June 2025: 8 infected

• July 2025: 13 infected

(No deaths, births, immigration, or recovery occurred during the study.)

a\. Calculate the monthly incidence of M. leprae infection. Show your calculations and state the units.\
**March: 3/60 = 0.05 cases per armadillo-month**\
**April: 5/57 = 0.088 cases per armadillo-month**\
**May: 5/52 = 0.096 cases per armadillo-month**\
**June: 8/47 = 0.17 cases per armadillo-month**\
**July: 13/39 = 0.333 cases per armadillo-month**

b\. Which month had the highest prevalence? Which month had the lowest prevalence? Show your calculations and state the units.\
**March: 3/60 = 0.05 = 5% (lowest prevalence)**\
**April: 5/60 = 0.083 = 8.33%**\
**May: 5/60 = 0.083 = 8.33%**\
**June: 8/60 = 0.133 = 13.33%**\
**July: 13/60 = 0.2167 = 21.67% (highest prevalence)**

5\. A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia.

a\. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers? **Regarding the etiological agent of Tularemia, it is a zoonotic infection caused by Francisella tularensis, which is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium. The subspecies of this agent that causes Tularemia in aquatic animals like beavers is its Type B, called subspecies holartica.**

b\. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent? **The routes of transmission include vector-borne (e.g., tick and deer fly bites), direct contact (e.g., handling infected animals), inhalation (e.g., contaminated aerosols or dust), and ingestion (e.g., contaminated water or undercooked game).**

c\. Describe key features/characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/ public health. **A key feature of this pathogen in the context of human and public health includes the fact that its symptoms/forms depend on the route of transmission. Another characteristic is that its incubation period is 1-21 days, with the onset of symptoms usually occurring in 1-5 days. Further, no reports have been made of its spread from person to person—therefore, humans are considered dead-end hosts.**

6\. Match the following:

a\. Fungal pathogen of conservation concern – **5. Pseudogymnoascus destructans**

b\. Avian Vacuolar Myelinopathy – **4. Aetokthonotoxin**

c\. Tick-transmitted viral disease – **1. Powassan encephalitis**

d\. Foreign Animal Disease – **6. African Swine Fever**

e\. Bell’s palsy, Bulls-eye rash – **3. Borrelia burgdorferi**

7\. Refer to the life cycle of blacklegged tick to answer 7a – 7d.

a\. The two stages of blacklegged tick that can potentially transmit Lyme disease to humans are: **nymph** and **adult**.

b\. Preferred hosts of the larval stage of Ixodes scapularis are: **mice** and **birds**.

c\. Lyme disease risk posed by host-seeking nymphs of I. scapularis is greatest during **late-May, June, and early-July (between Spring and Summer)**; while Lyme disease risk posed by host-seeking adults is greatest during **late-October, November, and early-December (between Fall and Winter)**.

d\. The natural reservoir and competent hosts of Borrelia burgdorferi in North America: **white-footed mice**. White-tailed deer are the **preferred host (but not effective reservoirs)** in the Lyme disease system.

8\. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white-tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. **A rule of thumb for calculating ideal sample size is to use the equation N = 3/p, where N is the sample size and p is the hypothesized prevalence. In this case, N = 3/0.002 = 1,500; therefore, I would comment that the DNR’s number of samples tested is a bit less than the ideal sample size for their surveillance efforts. I would also note that the main downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making such decisions is the inherent nature of variability and ever-changing conditions in the wild, which often differs from the rigid structure of such a distribution.**

9\.

Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the figure. Explain your choice of quadrants.

a\. SARS-CoV-2 **– upper left – higher within species transmission, lower between species transmission**

b\. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome – **lower right – lower within species transmission, higher between species transmission**

c\. Langya Henipavirus **– lower right – lower within species transmission, higher between species transmission**

d\. Brucellosis **– upper right – higher within species transmission, higher between species transmission**

e\. West Nile virus **– lower left – lower within species transmission, lower between species transmission**

10\. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm Anisakis simplex. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers. **Definitive host: marine mammals – facilitate completion of cycle (defecate eggs into ocean); dead-end host: humans – their cycle ends when ingested by humans; paratenic host: seafish and cephalopods – ingest but do not serve as final host (they are the second intermediate host); intermediate host: crustaceans – they are consumed by paratenic hosts.**

11\. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. **This statement is not accurate – it is important to remember that infection is not the same as disease. An animal can be infected without disease (i.e., a pathogen can cause infection without noticeable symptoms). An example would be an asymptomatic carrier of a virus – they are infected but are not showing any sign of illness.**

12\. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV? **The vaccination coverage necessary to achieve herd immunity is 1 - (1 / R0) = 1 - (1 / 2.5) = 0.6 = 60% of the seal population.**

13\. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples. **There are a number of challenges in managing wildlife diseases. For one, often times there are no vaccinations or treatments available to combat the disease (e.g., Chronic Wasting Disease). For another, in cases when there is a treatment, the problem may be so widespread that there are logistical/practical challenges to applying the treatment in the wild (this can occur when resources are limited, or the scale or rate of spread far exceeds the capabilities of the administering efforts). Another challenge is the ability to track/monitor cases in the wild - especially in instances of diseases with long incubation periods or simply hard-to-detect symptoms. Further, issues with coordinating/collaborating with multiple stakeholders can impact the ability to implement treatments, which is also seen in the case of Chronic Wasting Disease, with hunters, BLM, Department of Agriculture, and more, often seeking various end goals.**
